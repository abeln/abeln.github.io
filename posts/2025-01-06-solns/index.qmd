## Exercise 1.2.1

a. To verify that $\textbf{Pno}$ is a category we need to check that composition of arrows is well-defined and that the identity arrow behaves as expected.

   Let $(A, \alpha, a) \xrightarrow{f} (B, \beta, b)$ and $(B, \beta, b) \xrightarrow{g} (C, \gamma, c)$.

   Then we have:
    - $(g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)) = c$
    - The second coherence condition follows from
      \begin{align*}
        (g \circ f) \circ \alpha &= g \circ (f \circ \alpha) \\
        &= g \circ (\beta \circ f) \\
        &= (g \circ \beta) \circ f \\
        &= (\gamma \circ g) \circ f \\
        &= \gamma \circ (g \circ f)
        \end{align*}
