<body><article><p>The following note defines a notion of <i>similarity</i> for <i>labelled-transition systems</i> (LTS) and shows how, by placing certain finiteness conditions
on the LTS, similarity can be iteratively computed. None of what follows is novel, and is sourced from Davide Sangiorgi's excellent
<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/introduction-to-bisimulation-and-coinduction/8B54001CB763BAE9C4BA602C0A341D60">introduction to coinduction and
bisimulation</a>.</p>
<p>An LTS is a triple \((Pr, Act, \rightarrow)\), where \(Pr\) is the set of <i>processes</i> (states), \(Act\) is a set of
<i>actions</i> (labels), and \( \rightarrow \subseteq Pr \times Act \times Pr \) is the <i>transition relation</i>. We will write
\( P \rightarrow_{\mu} Q \) for \( (P, \mu, Q) \).</p>
<p>A <i>simulation</i> is a relation \( R \subseteq Pr \times Pr \) such that if \( (P, Q) \in R \), then</p>
<ul><li> for all \( P' \) such that \( P \rightarrow_{\mu} P'  \), there exists a \( Q' \) such that
\( Q \rightarrow_{\mu} Q' \) and \( (P', Q') \in R \).</li></ul>
<p><i>Similarity</i>, denoted by \( \le \), is the union of all simulations; additionally, it too is a simulation.
When \( P \le Q \) we say that \( Q \) <i>simulates</i> \( P \) (note the order is reversed).</p>
<p>For example, the following LTS models a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol">two-phase commit</a> protocol with two clients,
while keeping track of which clients have committed (C) or aborted (A). The transitions are unlabelled because we have only one action (e.g. \( \mu \)):</p>.

<p>If we want to model the protocol at a higher level, we can decide not to keep track of the state of the clients:</p>

<p>We then need a way to relate the two models: we can use similarity to that effect. We can see that \( Init \le Init' \), all the C and A states are simulated by Procc, \( Commit \le Commit' \), and \( Abort \le Abort' \).</p></article></body></html>
