<body><article> <section><p><span class="newthought">This note</span> defines a notion of <i>similarity</i> for <i>labelled-transition systems</i> (LTS) and shows how, by placing certain finiteness conditions
on the LTS, similarity can be iteratively computed. In the process, we will see how similarity can be a concrete example of the trick for &quot;commuting quantifiers&quot; described in
<a href="https://tildeweb.au.dk/au571806/blog/commuting_quantifiers/">Amin Timany's blog</a>. None of what follows is novel, and is sourced from Davide Sangiorgi's excellent
<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/introduction-to-bisimulation-and-coinduction/8B54001CB763BAE9C4BA602C0A341D60">introduction to coinduction and
bisimulation</a>.</p></section>
 <section><p><span class="newthought">A labelled-transition system</span> is a triple \((Pr, Act, \rightarrow)\), where \(Pr\) is the set of <i>processes</i> (states), \(Act\) is a set of
<i>actions</i> (labels), and \( \rightarrow \subseteq Pr \times Act \times Pr \) is the <i>transition relation</i>. We will write
\( P \rightarrow_{\mu} Q \) for \( (P, \mu, Q) \).</p>
<p>A <i>simulation</i> is a relation \( R \subseteq Pr \times Pr \) such that if \( (P, Q) \in R \), then for all \( P' \) such that \( P \rightarrow_{\mu} P'  \), there exists a \( Q' \) such that
\( Q \rightarrow_{\mu} Q' \) and \( (P', Q') \in R \).</p>
<p><i>Similarity</i>, denoted by \( \le \), is the union of all simulations.
 When \( P \le Q \) we say that \( Q \) <i>simulates</i> \( P \) (note the order is reversed).
For example, the following LTS models a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol">two-phase commit</a> protocol with two clients,
while keeping track of which clients have committed (C) or aborted (A). The transitions are unlabelled because we have only one action (e.g. \( \mu \)):</p>

<p>If we want to model the protocol at a higher level, we can decide to not keep track of the client state:</p>
<img src="2pc-simple.png" style="height:200px" />
<p>We then need a way to relate the two models: we can use similarity to that effect. We can see that \( Init \le Init' \), all the C and A states are simulated by Procc, \( Commit \le Commit' \), and \( Abort \le Abort' \).
For example, the sequence \( [Init, C_1, A_2, Abort] \) is simulated by \( [Init', Procc, Procc, Abort'] \).</p></section>
<section><p><span class="newthought">Working on the complete</span> <i>powerset lattice</i> \( \mathcal{P}(Procc \times Procc) \), we can obtain similarity as the greatest <i>fixpoint</i> of a <i>functional</i>
\( F : \mathcal{P}({Procc \times Procc}) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}({Procc \times Procc}) \) given by
<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">The intuition for \( F \) is that it gives us all pairs  \( (P, Q) \) where \( Q \) can simulate  \( P \) <i>for one step</i> and after that one step <i>we end up in a pair of states in \( R \). </i> </span>
\[ F(R) = \{ (P, Q) | \forall P', P \rightarrow_\mu P' \implies \exists Q', Q \rightarrow_\mu Q' \land (P', Q') \in R \} \]
<b>Fact 1. </b> \( R \) is a simulation iff \( R \) is a post-fixpoint of \( F \) (i.e. \( R \subseteq F(R) \) ).
<br />
<b>Corollary 2. </b> similarity is  F's greatest fixpoint (follows by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knaster%E2%80%93Tarski_theorem">Knaster-Tarski</a>).</p>
<p>Moreover, we can stratify similarity through a family of relations \( \{ \le_n \} \) capturing <i>similarity up to \(n\) steps</i>:
<ul><li>\( \le_0 = Pr \times Pr \)</li>
<li> \( \le_{n + 1} = F(\le_n) \)</li></ul></p>
<p>To compute similarity, we'd like to know that \( P \le Q \) iff  \( P \le_n Q \) <i>for all n</i>; i.e.
  $$ \le = \bigcap_{i \ge 0} \le_i $$
If so, we could compute \( \le_0, \le_1, \ldots, \le_n, \ldots \)
Since \( F \) is monotone, if at any point we reach a fixpoint \( \le_n = F(\le_{n}) = \le_{n + 1} \), then we know that
$$  \bigcap_{i \ge 0} \le_i = \le_n $$</p></section></article></body></html>
