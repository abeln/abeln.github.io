<body><article><h1>Simulations and Commuting Quantifiers</h1>
<h3>March, 2021</h3>
<section><p><span class="newthought">This note</span> defines a notion of <i>similarity</i> for <i>labelled-transition systems</i> (LTS) and shows how, by placing certain finiteness conditions
on the LTS, similarity can be iteratively computed. In the process, we will see how similarity can be a concrete example of the &quot;trick&quot; for commuting quantifiers described in
<a href="https://tildeweb.au.dk/au571806/blog/commuting_quantifiers/">Amin Timany's blog</a>. The presentation is based on Davide Sangiorgi's excellent
<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/introduction-to-bisimulation-and-coinduction/8B54001CB763BAE9C4BA602C0A341D60">introduction to coinduction and
bisimulation</a>.</p></section>
<section><p><span class="newthought">A labelled-transition system</span> is a triple \((Pr, Act, \rightarrow)\), where \(Pr\) is the set of <i>processes</i> (states), \(Act\) is a set of
<i>actions</i> (labels), and \( \rightarrow \subseteq Pr \times Act \times Pr \) is the <i>transition relation</i>. We will write
\( P \rightarrow_{\mu} Q \) for \( (P, \mu, Q) \).</p>
<p>A <i>simulation</i> is a relation \( R \subseteq Pr \times Pr \) such that if \( (P, Q) \in R \), then for all \( P' \) such that \( P \rightarrow_{\mu} P'  \), there exists a \( Q' \) such that
\( Q \rightarrow_{\mu} Q' \) and \( (P', Q') \in R \).</p>
<p><i>Similarity</i>, denoted by \( \le \), is the union of all simulations.
When \( P \le Q \) we say that \( Q \) <i>simulates</i> \( P \) (note the order is reversed).
For example, the following LTS models a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol">two-phase commit</a> (2PC) protocol with two clients,
while keeping track of which clients have committed (C) or aborted (A). The transitions are unlabelled because we have only one action (e.g. \( \mu \)):</p>
<img src="2pc.png" style="height:300px" />
<p>If we want to model the protocol at a higher level, we can decide to not keep track of the client state:</p>
<img src="2pc-simple.png" style="height:200px" />
<p>We then need a way to relate the two models: we can use similarity to that effect. We can see that \( Init \le Init' \), all the C and A states are simulated by Procc, \( Commit \le Commit' \), and \( Abort \le Abort' \).
For example, the sequence \( [Init, C_1, A_2, Abort] \) is simulated by \( [Init', Procc, Procc, Abort'] \).</p></section>
<section><p><span class="newthought">Working on the complete</span> <i>powerset lattice</i> \( \mathcal{P}(Procc \times Procc) \), we can obtain similarity as the greatest <i>fixpoint</i> of a <i>functional</i>
\( F : \mathcal{P}({Procc \times Procc}) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}({Procc \times Procc}) \) given by
<label for="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">The intuition for \( F \) is that it gives us all pairs  \( (P, Q) \) where \( Q \) can simulate  \( P \) <i>for one step</i> and after that one step <i>we end up in a pair of states in \( R \). </i> </span>
\[ F(R) = \{ (P, Q) | \forall P', P \rightarrow_\mu P' \implies \exists Q'. Q \rightarrow_\mu Q' \land (P', Q') \in R \} \]
<p><u><b>Fact 1.</b></u> \( R \) is a simulation iff \( R \) is a post-fixpoint of \( F \) (i.e. \( R \subseteq F(R) \) ).
<br />
<u><b>Corollary 2.</b></u> similarity is  F's greatest fixpoint (follows by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knaster%E2%80%93Tarski_theorem">Knaster-Tarski</a>).</p></p>
<p>Moreover, we can stratify similarity through a family of relations \( \{ \le_n \} \) capturing <i>similarity up to \(n\) steps</i>:
<ul><li>\( \le_0 = Pr \times Pr \)</li>
<li> \( \le_{n + 1} = F(\le_n) \)</li></ul></p>
<p>To compute similarity, we'd like to know that \( P \le Q \) iff  \( P \le_n Q \) <i>for all n</i>; i.e.
$$ \le = \bigcap_{i \ge 0} \le_i $$
If so, we could compute \( \le_0, \le_1, \ldots, \le_n, \ldots \)
Since \( F \) is monotone, then we can stop computing as soon as we reach a fixpoint \( \le_n = F(\le_{n}) = \le_{n + 1} \). In that case
$$  \le = \bigcap_{i \ge 0} \le_i = \le_n $$
The fixpoint algorithm can be implemented more or less verbatim (<a href="simil-src.html">Scala source</a>).
For the 2PC models above, we indeed get that \( Init \le Init' \) as expected.

<p>Unfortunately the method above doesn't always work. In the example below, \( A \) we can take \( n \) a-steps <i>for any</i> \( n \),
so \( C \le_n A \) and \( (C, A) \in \bigcap_{ i \ge 0} \le_i \). However, \( A \) <i>cannot</i> simulate \( C \) because \( C \) can take infinitely many steps whereas \( A \) needs to &quot;commit&quot; to
one of the \( B_i \), and from then on it can only take a finite number of steps. </p>

<img src="sim-n.png" style="height:200px" />
<p>To see what the problem is, it helps to try to carry out the proof that \( \le = \bigcap_{i \ge 0} \le_i \) and see where it breaks.
For this, we need to show that \( \le \subseteq \bigcap_{i \ge 0}  \) and \( \bigcap_{i \ge 0} \subseteq \le \). The first goal goes through without problems.
Notice that
$$ \begin{align}
 \le &amp; \subseteq Pr \times Pr &amp;= \le_0 \\
 \le = F(\le) &amp; \subseteq F(\le_0) &amp;= \le_1 \\
 \le = F(\le) &amp; \subseteq F(\le_1) &amp;= \le_2 \\
 \ldots &amp; &amp;
\end{align} $$
Using the fact that \( \le \) is a fixpoint and \( F \) is monotone we can proceed by induction to show that \( \le \subseteq \le_n \) for all \( n \), and
the result follows.</p>
<p>It's the second goal that gives us trouble. We need to show that \( \bigcap_{i \ge 0} \le_i \subseteq \le \). Since similarity is the largest simulation,
it's enough to show that  \( \bigcap_{i \ge 0} \le_i \) is a simulation. That is, given that \( (P, Q) \in \bigcap_{i \ge 0} \le_i \) and assuming that \( P \rightarrow_\mu P' \), we
have to show that there exists a Q' such that \( Q \rightarrow_\mu Q\ \) and \( (Q, Q') \in \bigcap_{i \ge 0} \le_i \). Because  \( (P, Q) \in \bigcap_{i \ge 0} \le_i \) we know that <i>for each \(i\)</i>
we can find a \( Q'_i \) such that \( Q \rightarrow_\mu Q'_i \) and \( (P', Q'_i ) \in \le_i \). That is, we know
$$ \forall i. \exists Q'. Q \rightarrow_\mu Q' \land (P', Q') \in \le_i $$
But we need
$$ \exists Q'. \forall i. Q \rightarrow_\mu Q' \land (P', Q') \in \le_i $$
Of course, we know we can't simply swap the quantifiers, which is consistent with the counterexample we saw above.
In the counterexample, process \( A \) had infinitely-many outgoing transitions, so one (not very intuitive) question to ask is whether restricting the LTS to being <i>finitely branching</i> solves the problem (it does).</p>
<p><u><b>Definition 3.</b></u> An LTS is finitely branching if for every process \( P \) the set \( \{ (\mu, Q) | P \rightarrow_\mu Q \in \rightarrow \} \) is finite.</p>
<p>We now finally get to the meat of the matter: if the LTS is finitely branching, then we can exchange the quantifiers.</p>
<p><u><b>Lemma 4.</b></u> If the underlying LTS is finitely branching, then
$$ \forall i. \exists Q'. Q \rightarrow_\mu Q' \land (P', Q') \in \le_i $$
implies
$$ \exists Q'. \forall i. Q \rightarrow_\mu Q' \land (P', Q') \in \le_i $$
<b><u>Proof.</u></b>
Let \( M = \{ Q\ | Q \rightarrow_\mu Q' \in \rightarrow \} \). Since the LTS is finitely branching, then \( M \) is finite.
From the assumption, we can construct a function \( f(i) = Q_i \) that assigns to every index \( i \) and element \( Q_i \in M \).
Now define the <i>fiber</i> \( f^{-1}(e) \) of an element \( e \) to be the inverse image of the singleton set containing \( e \):
$$ f^{-1}(Q') = \{ i | f(i) = Q' \} $$
Notice that the set of natural numbers can be partitioned as the union of the fibers of elements of \( M \):
$$ \mathbb{N} = \bigcup_{Q' \in M} f^{-1}(Q') $$
Now look at the cardinalities on each side of the equation above. \( \mathbb{N} \) is infinite, and there are finitely many \( Q' \in M \).
This means that at least one of the elements has an <i>infinite</i> fiber. Let \( Q' \) be one such element.
Now consider an arbitrary index \( i \). Since \( f^{-1}(Q') \) is infinite, there exists a \( j &gt; i \) such that \( j \in f^{-1}(Q') \),
meaning that \( f(j) = Q' \).
In turn, this means that
$$ Q \rightarrow_\mu Q' \land (P', Q') \in \le_i $$
Since \( i \) was arbitrarily chosen, we get
$$ \forall i, Q \rightarrow_\mu Q' \land (P', Q') \in \le_i $$
which is allows us to instantiate the existential in our goal. \( \blacksquare \)</p></section>
<section><p>The abstract view of Lemma 4 above is given in Theorem 1 (Regular Quantification) of <a href="https://tildeweb.au.dk/au571806/blog/commuting_quantifiers/">Amin's blog post</a>:
<blockquote><p>Let A be a regular ordinal, [...] and B be a set with strictly smaller cardinality [...].
The following holds for any \( P \) that is downwards closed with respect to the
relation on A:
$$ (\forall x \in A. \exists y \in B. P(x, y) ) \implies \exists y \in B. \forall x \in A. P(x, y) $$</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Contrast with a version of Lemma 4 massaged to highlight the parallels
$$ ( \forall i \in \mathbb{N}. \exists Q' \in succ(Q, \mu). \mathcal{L}(i, Q') ) \implies  \exists Q' \in succ(Q, \mu). \forall i \in \mathbb{N}. \mathcal{L}(i, Q') $$
where
$$ \begin{align}
   succ(Q, \mu) &amp;= \{ Q' | Q \rightarrow_\mu Q' \} \\
   \mathcal{L}(i, Q') &amp;= (P', Q') \in \le_i
   \end{align}
$$</p>
<p>In order to use Theorem 1, we need
<ul><li> <i>\( \mathbb{N} \) must be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_cardinal">regular ordinal</a></i>. For our purposes, this means the following: suppose we have an <i>unbounded</i> subset \( S \) of \( \mathbb{N} \)
 (i.e. for any natural number \( n \) no matter how large, we can always find an element \( e \in S \) such that \( e &gt; n \)). Then we need to show
 there exists an <i>injective</i> function \( f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow S \).
 We can recursively construct one such function. We will set \( f(0) \) to an arbitrary element of \( S \). For the recursive case,
 we are given \( f(n - 1) \) and have to define \( f(n) \). Since \( S \) is unbounded, there's an element \( e \in S \) such that \( e &gt; f(n - 1) \). We set \( f(n) = e \).
 It's easy to see that if \( n &lt; m \) then \( f(n) &lt; f(m) \); this means \( f \) is injective as needed. \( \blacksquare \)</li>
<li> <i>\( succ(Q, \mu) \) must have strictly smaller cardinality than  \( \mathbb{N} \)</i>. This is easy, because since the LTS is finitely branching \( succ(Q, \mu) \) must be finite, and \( \mathbb{N} \) is infinite.  \( \blacksquare \)</li>
<li> <i>\( \mathcal{L}(i, Q') \) is <i>downwards-closed</i>
<label for="sn-closed" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sn-closed" class="margin-toggle" />
<span class="sidenote">This means that \( n \ge m \land \mathcal{L}(n, Q') \implies \mathcal{L}(m, Q') \) </span></i>. Here we need to show that if \( n \ge m \) then
$$ P' \le_n Q' \implies P' \le_m Q' $$
That is, if \( Q' \) can simulate \( P' \) for \( n \) steps, then it can simulate it for \( m \) steps.
This makes intuitive sense, and follows from the fact that functional \( F \) used to generate \( \le_n \) is monotone. \( \blacksquare \)</li></ul></p></section>
