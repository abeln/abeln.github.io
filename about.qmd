I'm a compiler engineer at NVIDIA, working on compilation of large language models to domain-specific architectures for inference acceleration.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from Aarhus University, Denmark, where I worked on modular specification and formal verification of distributed systems using separation logic and the Roc proof assistant.

My interests are in the areas of programming languages, compilers, and formal verification.
