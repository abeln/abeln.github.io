         Hello! My name is Abel, and Iâ€™m a PhD student at Aarhus University, where
         I'm a member of the @a[href: "https://cs.au.dk/research/logic-and-semantics/"]{Logic and Semantics} group,
         as well as the @a[href: "https://cs.au.dk/research/centers/cpv/"]{Center for Basic Research in Program Verification}.
         My advisor is @a[href: "https://cs.au.dk/~birke/"]{Lars Birkedal}.
       }
       @p{
         I work on @a[href: "https://iris-project.org/"]{formal verification} of distributed systems. I'm also interested in programming language design, type theory,
         program analysis, and compilers.
